TODO
----
* use image size to set puzzle piece dimensions accordingly
* bug on surface where drag start causes piece to shift suddenly
    * this is caused by getting a DragAt event after a DragEnd event for the same
* allow custom selection of puzzle dimensions (3x3, 5x7 etc.)
---
* add foreground index to model instead of needing to go thru entire dictionary to find the max index
* allow rotating pieces
* allow upload of custom images
* disallow snapping to knob that's already snapped
* clean up point vs position nonsense
* For speed up, only compare distances squared to avoid the sqrt computation
* If needed, implement k-d tree for faster closest snap point computation
