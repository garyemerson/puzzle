* overlay images on puzzle pieces
* allow upload of custom images
* allow custom selection of puzzle dimensions (3x3, 5x7 etc.)
* disallow snapping to knob that's already snapped
* clean up point vs position nonsense
* For speed up, only compare distances squared to avoid the sqrt computation
* If needed, implement k-d tree for faster closest snap point computation
